> ## say_the_number is the challenge attempted

### __Ruby__ is the programming language I used to attempt the solution

[code on git hub](https://github.com/T-WaRa-N/HDFLHTC "say_the_number")

* git clone in to your local machine
* I suggest you run it on replit or VS Code locally

The challenge was breaking-down the problem into solvable chunks, it took me sometime and I finally decided on a logic. It is a doable project I manage to finish 50% with the time I had in the time fram I was given. I did not include test suits in this submission. The logic I chose took me  time and I did not have enough time on these days I got the problem other than that the level of difficulty is fair and if I could be given extra time, with your persmission I can solve the problem well. 

The problem become more complex as I get to close to the solution but my logic and approach was ok as per my analysis. Each function took car of each section of the number for an example hundreds, thousands and so on were dealt incrementally.
